# Scripts and automation 

A quick repo for some scripts I've used at least twice.

| lsdLinux86Setup.sh| Pulls the MUSL version of lsd (lsdeluxe) and installs in the users home directory for linux x86 systems| 
| memLeakCheck.ps1| Powershell script to check if memory usage is too high for processes|
